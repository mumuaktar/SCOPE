Label extraction of stroke diagnosis from unstructured medical reports using Retrieval-Augmented Generation


This study introduces SCOPE, a novel approach combining modern Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to extract stroke diagnosis labels from unstructured medical reports. This method addresses the challenges of manually labeling datasets in neuroradiology, offering an AI-assisted solution that generates labeled datasets linked to patient imaging data while avoiding privacy concerns associated with cloud-based tools. SCOPE eliminates the need to retrain existing models, which is expensive and time-consuming, and it serves as a general framework that can be extended to extract other types of labels from medical reports, which can support further clinical research.
